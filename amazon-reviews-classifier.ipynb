      "1: I bought Nessie as a treat to myself, so that I could use some leaf teas that I had been given. I love the idea and it is well built, but I found filling and closing to be a bit of a chore given the relatively narrow/shallow nature of the holding chamber. I also found that it was hard to get water to circulate through the holes as air got trapped and blocked them. But, it did still make my tea so for that I give it a thumbs up!\n",
      "1: i saw this and i just fell in love with it. im a big tea fan and recently got into the loose tea leaves. this is easy to clean and i love the design of it too. it is a bit on the pricey side but if you love your tea and dont want to have to loose leaves flowing into your mouth, i would highly recommend this product. ive seen other ones where they can hook into the side of the cup or mugs. i use a flask mug so i cant hook those designs onto my mug. because of nessies long neck, i have no problem of lifting it out when im done.\n",
      "1: bought specifically since it super easy to clean unlike many other novelty infusers that are oddly shaped. The silicone is starting to stain with use (1year on)\n",
      "1: Absolutely adorable! Maybe not the best infuser ever invented, but the cuteness makes up for that. The one issue I have, that isn't even worth knocking down the score, is that the holes are just a touch too big and smaller leaves fall out. That's common with this type of infuser though.\n",
      "1: As a tea strainer it is not that great, you are going to gets bits of leaf in your tea unless you use larger leaves. However, it is so adorable that I don't even care if it doesn't quite do it's function to perfection, cause darn it that little face and the stumpy little legs are a great addition to anyone's life.\n",
      "1: Everything about this is amazing, I want everything I own to be dinosaur shaped.\n",
      "1: I love dino!  The holes are abit big so expect some seepage of leaves if he stots about in your cup, however does infuse really well and love seeing his wee face peeking over the cup-edge.\n",
      "1: Was so excited as looks amazing but very disappointed with the amount of tea leaves which escaped through the holes. Whole point was to have no bits 😕\n",
      "0: very small but quite cute. It is a lovely colour and looks very sturdy, the box discription bodes well. Requested by a friend for christmas, I know she will love it.\n",
      "1: This tea infuser is easy to use and to clean. It is also an excellent talking point whilst waiting for the tea to brew. The only thing that would make it better if it was actually made in Scotland.\n",
      "0: Lovely\n",
      "1: works really well\n",
      "0: Very cute and makes a great present\n",
      "0: Love it!!!!!\n",
      "1: Really cute and easy to use and clean!\n",
      "1: Its kind of cute I suppose, and works fairly well, I am no tea expert myself, but I sort of expected it to not leak out quite that much of the leaves. There's normally enough that make their way out to cover half the bottom of my mug. I got this after accidentally buying a pack of loose tea, and not wanting to waste it, but in terms of ease of use I would probably stick with tea bags in the future, as they don't leave tea leaves in the bottom of my mug.\n",
      "1: Cracking novelty item but a bit naff as a tea strainer. The holes are too big so the tea falls through and there's not enough of them so some gentle assistance is required to get the tea water through it.\n",
      "0: I'm happy about this product.\n",
      "0: bought as a gift, it is cute and fun, very pleased with it.\n",
      "0: Bought as a gift and I have been informed it is great. The head is above water level in alot of mugs so is good for stiring also.\n",
      "1: Looks good. Some tea leaves came out from the holes in the bottom. Did not do a good job of infusing the water.\n",
      "1: Great novelty product, be aware it's not suitable for all teas - large holes not suitable for fine teas and can need a bit of wiggling about to get it to infuse as there aren't many holes. Still regularly used, even a year later now.\n",
      "1: Fab design, works well and is easy to clean out (unlike many others of these diffusers!).  Really pleased with it!\n",
      "1: Looks so cute and is good quality.\n",
      "1: Very good quality, soft and excellent material. You can use it in any cup, makes a perfect and strong tea. Highly recommended\n",
      "1: So cute and well made. Easily used with loose tea or even a tea bag (mine kept splitting randomly). Surprisingly a good size for all my cups\n",
      "1: Cute but it does let tea leaves through the holes\n",
      "0: Excellent.\n",
      "1: very goof as advertised\n",
      "1: Fun-looking tea infuser with enough space to also fit loose leaf tea quantities for larger mugs. Easy clean and assembly.\n",
      "1: fun, good size, works well, just a pain to clean!\n",
      "1: Really love this. Holds just the right amount of loose tea.\n",
      "0: Lovely item.\n",
      "1: Sooooo cute, excellent packaging. recommend to anyone\n",
      "1: Easy to clean, easy to fit parts together!\n",
      "1: Lovely infuser, it does let some tiniest leaves come out into the mug, but I don't mind honestly.\n",
      "1: Unfortunately it doesn’t work. Very messy to fill, fiddly to close and leaks tea. Don’t bother.\n",
      "1: Even more adorable than you think, however the holes are big enough for the small bits to sneak out.\n",
      "1: The holes are too big and the tea falls through. Will be returning.\n",
      "1: Really cute but becomes discoloured quite fast when using black tea.\n",
      "1: The tea leafs leak out the side\n",
      "0: Lovely item. May order more!\n",
      "1: A must for a tea lover. Super cute\n",
      "0: Lovely, cute gift, arrived before estimated delivery date, well packaged and was exactly what I expected. Thank you!\n",
      "0: very cute but a bit fiddly - prom delievery - thanks\n",
      "1: Amazing and beautiful! I am so pleased with my little Nessie. It works perfectly :)\n",
      "1: Cracking little infuser. Cool design and does the job very well.\n",
      "1: Very cute! Works great and arrived quickly\n",
      "0: Great to look at and works a treat\n",
      "0: Arrived quickly and everything fine till I picked out a 2nd item for my little one to eat (Animal Bar) which had a sticky residue all over the wrapper. I assumed a chew bar had melted and caused the mess. Opened it to check it was alright only to find very old spoiled chocolate inside. Despite exp saying 2018. These things happen but the other bars should be checked before more boxs are dispatched, just Incase an unsupervised child eats it. Edit - other chocolate items also spoiled (see photos) Disappointed!\n",
      "0: Brought this for my  Brothers Birthday and i was a tad worried as some of the reviews but decided to order it anyways :) really glad I did!\n",
      "0: Very disappointed in this, it's very small whereas the picture and price gives the impression that it's going to be really big & impressive. I would recommend that you buy the sweets from a shop and put in a big box yourselves! Save yourself a great deal of money and put a bigger smile on your children's faces!\n",
      "0: Bought this as a gift. I was reluctant to buy as i have seen some very negative reviews on similar products and its a bit of a gable on what your going to get. However i was very pleasantly surprised!\n",
      "0: I see a few people have moaned about this product.\n",
      "0: Well what can i say??? Nothing negative that's for sure!!  An all round classic for a babe of the 80s but loved by all generations.  The retro vibe brings tonnes of nostalgia, plus the sweets are all tasty well adored brands.  Even if you don't like the Parma violets, i'm sure you'll know someone who loves them and will snatch your hand off at the offer of them!!!  Warning do not open them with your friends present, your sweets will be snaffled before you can say 'sherbert fountain'.  You could argue that it is expensive compared to buying them individually, but I'm sure it compensates over shopping around at your time and petrol costs.  Great gift for any sweet lover if you're at despair of wondering what to buy them for their birthday or Christmas!!\n",
      "0: We ordered this as a present for our son.  Unfortunately the chocolate bar was discoloured and had to be thrown away.  This product is  of a poor quality and I would not recommend buying it.\n",
      "0: Although it arrived well packed in a pretty box the amount of sweets was very poor for the money\n",
      "0: What do you get the guy who has everything?\n",
      "0: Partner loved this gift ... but the chocolate  in the box was not good glad i opened the chocolate and not him\n",
      "0: A cute and quirky product however a lot of money for a cardboard box and some sweets!!\n",
      "0: For what you pay for this you get soooooo much stuff i was excited just opening it and it burst open full of goodies. There was old fashion sweets that you cant get anymore, sweets from now. Very 90s kind of vibe love it\n",
      "0: All chocolate was mouldedy and melted\n",
      "0: I purchased this as a side present for my husband's birthday and I'm so glad I did. Not only did he love the sweets but we both spent time reminiscing over past sweets we hadn't seen in years.\n",
      "0: Have always loved A Quarter of and used to buy them for my hubby too. They are such brilliant reminders of days gone by. This particular order was delivered so fast and I bought one for myself too 😉 The box is so well made and looks absolutely top notch. Thank you Michael for such a great company A Quarter of.  xxxxx\n",
      "0: Bought as a birthday gift for some-one who loves anything retro. Not given yet but certain they will love it. Came in a nice box but a bit Christmassy considering i needed it for another occasion, but doesn't take away from the quality or satisfaction. Would be nice to have an option of box designs though. Box is packed fully as apposed to large box and little content which is another plus. Very pleased and would recommend\n",
      "0: Bought as a Christmas present and the chocolate was mouldy. Wonder how old the rest of the sweets are. Not a great gift...\n",
      "0: Lovely box looks expensive and the sweets inside are great it reminds you of being a kid, id buy again and recomend, only negative is that the box was sent in plastic shrink wrap with the labels on so you had to take the plastic off, would be better put into a box so it doesn't get damaged on the ends other than that I was very happy.\n",
      "0: I ordered these for my grown up children ( in late 20s) as extra Christmas gifts. They were a great talking point as they rediscovered childhood favourites. Excellent range of sweets ranging from individual 'penny' chews to packets of jazzle chocolates and the much loved Animal Bar ( chocolate). I would definitely order again! Thank you!\n",
      "0: Great trade, trader and happy to do it again. Will be looking to buy from this trader\\s again.\n",
      "0: Bought for my 9yr old niece, her dentists won't be happy with me, but ah well, it's xmas!!!!\n",
      "0: Great sweets.......sent as a suprise for my neice and nephews and they loved them, got so excited opening them up and plenty to choose!\n",
      "0: Looked a lot more impressive in the pictures, slightly disappointed with it. Maybe should have read the description and not just gone off the picture\n",
      "0: Only thing missing is free dental work. Can’t wait to help the kids with this at xmas\n",
      "0: Bought this for my fiance's birthday and he absolutely loved it!! One of the best presents he has received\n",
      "0: Wow. Delivered within 2 days of ordering. Thanks . Quality product\n",

      "0: Overall a good selection of sweets and I like the fact that it has a contents list. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I thought there were too many bubblegums in there. Could maybe have substituted some of them for something else.\n",

      "0: I've bought a few different boxes of retro sweets as gifts the past year and I have to say that this is the best. The selection is great, it'sa great variety of truly retro sweets that everyone recognises. The quantity of sweets versus the value in this box is the best yet. Defo will be ordering again for the next time I have to get a present.\n",

      "0: What a massive rip off...I've just bought a couple of bags of sweets (Swizzels Bumper bag) for £1 each from a local store that contain 18 of the same sweets contained in this box. For about £3 I'd have the same amount! If I'd seen these bags before I bought this box I really wouldn't have bothered with it. But  I've removed all the bubblegum, there's too much for my liking, and replaced with all the lollies and chews from the bags I bought. I would definitely not recommend to anyone.\n",

The chocolate animal bar was spoiled, grey and unrecognisable as you can see in the pictures. The jazzles turned into a bar and looked unrecognisable as the other picture shows and the sweets didn't seem edible. Despite the date saying they went out of date in 2018 I would say these products went out of date already. Will not be purchasing again! Rubbish quality and a waste of money as it doesn't even seem edible! Really unhappy!!!\n",

      "0: Gave these to my son as he was born in the 90s as a blast from the past when he was younger and he loved them! Loads of sweets inside he's still picking at them a couple of weeks on. Notice some are moaning about price, I personally think for such a nice amount of sweets (plenty) and the gift box it comes in the price is very fair after all its a business they run not a charity! by the time you've traipsed around all the shops trying to find all the different sweets (which you won't as some i haven't seen in shops anymore) then bought a gift box you would definitely be more out of pocket. I will definitely be buying more at Christmas!! Very pleased :)\n",
      "0: I've ordered quite a few boxes from A Quarter Of as add-on birthday gifts throughout the years and they always put nostalgic smiles on faces. The selection and wide box encourage sharing and they're often passed around and shared with the whole room, which is great at birthday or celebration events as the adults get to talk about their childhood treats and the kids get interested and full of sugar at the same time.\n",
      "0: You can't beat retro sweets, this box includes pretty must all the greats. It was originally bought for my bridesmaids kiddies for on our wedding day, but they didn't arrive on time (my fault for ordering them so late, lol).
