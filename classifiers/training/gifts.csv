Happy with product..Bought as a gift and I have been informed it is great. The head is above water level in alot of mugs so is good for stiring also.,gift
"Baby Nessie.Lovely, cute gift, arrived before estimated delivery date, well packaged and was exactly what I expected. Thank you!",gift
Pleasantly surprised!.Bought this as a gift. I was reluctant to buy as i have seen some very negative reviews on similar products and its a bit of a gable on what your going to get. However i was very pleasantly surprised!,gift
"yum yum nom nom.Well what can i say??? Nothing negative that's for sure!!  An all round classic for a babe of the 80s but loved by all generations.  The retro vibe brings tonnes of nostalgia, plus the sweets are all tasty well adored brands.  Even if you don't like the Parma violets, i'm sure you'll know someone who loves them and will snatch your hand off at the offer of them!!!  Warning do not open them with your friends present, your sweets will be snaffled before you can say 'sherbert fountain'.  You could argue that it is expensive compared to buying them individually, but I'm sure it compensates over shopping around at your time and petrol costs.  Great gift for any sweet lover if you're at despair of wondering what to buy them for their birthday or Christmas!!",gift

"Not given yet but certain they will love it. Came in a nice box but a ....Bought as a birthday gift for some-one who loves anything retro. Not given yet but certain they will love it. Came in a nice box but a bit Christmassy considering i needed it for another occasion, but doesn't take away from the quality or satisfaction. Would be nice to have an option of box designs though. Box is packed fully as apposed to large box and little content which is another plus. Very pleased and would recommend",gift
Mouldy chocolate.Bought as a Christmas present and the chocolate was mouldy. Wonder how old the rest of the sweets are. Not a great gift...,gift
Excellent selection of sweets and memories - great value!.I ordered these for my grown up children ( in late 20s) as extra Christmas gifts. They were a great talking point as they rediscovered childhood favourites. Excellent range of sweets ranging from individual 'penny' chews to packets of jazzle chocolates and the much loved Animal Bar ( chocolate). I would definitely order again! Thank you!,gift

"Worth a fiver.I bought this on the £5 special offer deal. Pretty box, great stocking filler, but very small. I'm happy with it for a fiver, especially as I'm always able to lump thing together when buying via Amazon so get the 'free over £20' postage. However, I would have felt very unhappy with it if I had paid the headline price of £15.",gift
"cute and works well for loose tea leaf drinkers....i saw this and i just fell in love with it. im a big tea fan and recently got into the loose tea leaves. this is easy to clean and i love the design of it too. it is a bit on the pricey side but if you love your tea and dont want to have to loose leaves flowing into your mouth, i would highly recommend this product. ive seen other ones where they can hook into the side of the cup or mugs. i use a flask mug so i cant hook those designs onto my mug. because of nessies long neck, i have no problem of lifting it out when im done.",notgift
easy clean!.bought specifically since it super easy to clean unlike many other novelty infusers that are oddly shaped. The silicone is starting to stain with use (1year on),notgift
"Absolutely adorable! Maybe not the best infuser ever invented.Absolutely adorable! Maybe not the best infuser ever invented, but the cuteness makes up for that. The one issue I have, that isn't even worth knocking down the score, is that the holes are just a touch too big and smaller leaves fall out. That's common with this type of infuser though.",notgift
"Not perfect, but absolutely adorable.As a tea strainer it is not that great, you are going to gets bits of leaf in your tea unless you use larger leaves. However, it is so adorable that I don't even care if it doesn't quite do it's function to perfection, cause darn it that little face and the stumpy little legs are a great addition to anyone's life.",notgift
"It's a dinosaur and you make tea with him WHAT WILL THEY THINK OF NEXT.Everything about this is amazing, I want everything I own to be dinosaur shaped.",notgift
"Daft but works..I love dino!  The holes are abit big so expect some seepage of leaves if he stots about in your cup, however does infuse really well and love seeing his wee face peeking over the cup-edge.",notgift
Disappointing unless using large leaf tea.Was so excited as looks amazing but very disappointed with the amount of tea leaves which escaped through the holes. Whole point was to have no bits 😕,notgift
A Nessie-sary Kitchen Item.This tea infuser is easy to use and to clean. It is also an excellent talking point whilst waiting for the tea to brew. The only thing that would make it better if it was actually made in Scotland.,notgift
Five Stars.works really well,notgift
Five Stars.Love it!!!!!,notgift
Five Stars.Really cute and easy to use and clean!,notgift
"and not wanting to waste it, but in terms of ease of use ....Its kind of cute I suppose, and works fairly well, I am no tea expert myself, but I sort of expected it to not leak out quite that much of the leaves. There's normally enough that make their way out to cover half the bottom of my mug. I got this after accidentally buying a pack of loose tea, and not wanting to waste it, but in terms of ease of use I would probably stick with tea bags in the future, as they don't leave tea leaves in the bottom of my mug.",notgift
More of a Novelty.Cracking novelty item but a bit naff as a tea strainer. The holes are too big so the tea falls through and there's not enough of them so some gentle assistance is required to get the tea water through it.,notgift
Five Stars.I'm happy about this product.,notgift
Happy with product..Bought as a gift and I have been informed it is great. The head is above water level in alot of mugs so is good for stiring also.,notgift
"Great novelty product.Great novelty product, be aware it's not suitable for all teas - large holes not suitable for fine teas and can need a bit of wiggling about to get it to infuse as there aren't many holes. Still regularly used, even a year later now.",notgift
"works well and is easy to clean out (unlike many others of these diffusers.Fab design, works well and is easy to clean out (unlike many others of these diffusers!).  Really pleased with it!",notgift
Good product.Looks so cute and is good quality.,notgift
"Very good quality, soft and excellent material.Very good quality, soft and excellent material. You can use it in any cup, makes a perfect and strong tea. Highly recommended",notgift
Easily used with loose tea or even a tea bag ....So cute and well made. Easily used with loose tea or even a tea bag (mine kept splitting randomly). Surprisingly a good size for all my cups,notgift
Three Stars.Cute but it does let tea leaves through the holes,notgift
Five Stars.Excellent.,notgift
Five Stars.very goof as advertised,notgift
"Looks fun, works well for standard and bigger mugs.Fun-looking tea infuser with enough space to also fit loose leaf tea quantities for larger mugs. Easy clean and assembly.",notgift
"amazing value.Arrived promptly,amazing value",notgift
Five Stars.Great packaging and contents. Quick delivery too.  Good value,notgift
Fantastic!.A fab selection of retro sweets and great value. You've done it again AQO!,notgift
"there is a good variety of sweets included.Not really worth the money paid, however, there is a good variety of sweets included.",notgift
It was lucky to get 1 star.Wouldn’t waste your money. Go to a pound store and you can get twice as much cheaper than that. About 3 ‘retro’ sweets in it. Cannot stress really not worth the money,notgift
Four Stars.Very good,notgift

I hate this,notgift
A little on the large side as my grandaughter is rather slim. So I am referring to the 'width' of the garment rather than the length of jacket/sleeves etc.,notgift
Lovely coat - my daughter loves it. Fits well and is comfy. Would definitely recommend. We went for a bigger size so it will last her but it's still not too big to be uncomfortable,notgift
Very appealing pattern for little girls on a good quality rain jacket. Flannel lining will keep her from getting too hot. Perfect for the British Summer and will fold down into a bag well enough!,notgift
"This is H's third coat, so clearly we like them. Only 4 stars this time as the lining is not the usual towelling but a cheaper fabric",notgift
"Gorgeous coat, lovely for school spring and autumn. Something thicker needed for middle of winter. Lots of room so true to size as always with Hatley 😊",notgift
Beautiful fits perfect but I am waiting for my tesco visa bill as you were not going to send it and refund the money into above account as I thought it would be to small so depending on whether you refunded if you have I owe you for that article,notgift
This is a beautiful comfortable raincoat. It is very pretty. The quality is good and my daughter loves this coat. These are fairly true to size but you can also get a size bigger and turn the sleeves up if you like so you get more wear and it still looks lovely.,notgift
