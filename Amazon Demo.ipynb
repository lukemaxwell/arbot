I also found that it was hard to get water to circulate through the holes as air got trapped and blocked them. But, it did still make my tea so for that I give it a thumbs up!'],\n",

The one issue I have, that isn't even worth knocking down the score, is that the holes are just a touch too big and smaller leaves fall out. That's common with this type of infuser though.\"],\n",
